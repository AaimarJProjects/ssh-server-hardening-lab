# SSH Hardening and Linux Permissions Lab


## What this is

This is my hands on home lab where I practice cybersecurity concepts each week. I document everything I do, why I did it, and what I learned so that I can refer back to it and explain it to anyone. 



## Environment

-Windows 11 (SSH client)

-Ubuntu VM (target server)

-Kali Linux VM (attacker machine)



## Week 1 - SSH Server Hardening and Fail2Ban

This week I set up and hardened an SSH server on my Ubuntu VM. I changed the default port, disabled root login, set up key authentication,  disabled password authentication, and configured fail2ban to automatically ban IPs that fail to login too many times.

## Week 2 - Linux User Management and Permissions

This week I learned how Linux controls who can access what on a system. I learned how permission bits work, how special permissions like SetUID and sticky bits extend the standard model, how ACLs allow fine grained access control, and how to audit a system for dangerous permissions.

## Week 3 - Firewall Configuration and Network Security

This week I learned how the firewall layers on my Ubuntu server work together. I learned the difference between UFW, iptables, and nftables and how they connect to each other.
